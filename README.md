# Scratch on a Raspberry

## About

This project is part of my Masterthesis: «Learning Networks with new technologies like 
LoRa and connect it with physical computing».

[Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/): Running Scratch on a Raspberry Pi, add new extensions to
establish a connection with a running server to connect Scratch 
with Python.

## Scratch

This own scratch build is based on [scratch-vm](https://github.com/LLK/scratch-vm) and [scratch-gui](https://github.com/LLK/scratch-gui).
Both repositories were forked and supplemented with an own extension based on Scratch Extensions.

## Run local Scratch
